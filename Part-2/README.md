## 📖 Program Explanation
The `hello_world.cpp` file contains the following code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Breakdown:
- `#include <iostream>`: Includes the input-output stream library.
- `std::cout`: Outputs text to the console.
- `std::endl`: Inserts a newline and flushes the output buffer.
- `return 0;`: Indicates that the program ended successfully.
